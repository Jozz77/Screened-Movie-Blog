<!-- ## CODE SNIPPET FOR DROP ANIMATION

1. html code(note that you can change the name of the classes if need be)
   (note that the img src will have to be altered to fit the actual path of the image)

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="line">
    <img src="./Line 3.png" alt="" />
  </div>
  <div class="title">
    <h2>About</h2>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="container-2">
  <div class="line">
    <img src="./Line 3.png" alt="" />
  </div>
  <div class="title">
    <h2>Us</h2>
  </div>
</div>
```

2. css code (Make sure that whatever is housing the containers is positioned relatively i.e the header)
   (style the h2 elements as deemed fit)

```css
.container {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 40%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  animation: moveDown 2s ease-in;
  margin-right: 200px;
}
.container-2 {
  position: absolute;
  top: -100px;
  left: 60%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  animation: moveDown 2s ease-in;
  animation-delay: 0.5s;
  animation-fill-mode: backwards;
}

@keyframes moveDown {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(-1000px);
  }

  40% {
    transform: translateY(50px);
  }
  60% {
    transform: translateY(-20px);
  }

  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0px);
  }
}
