      Screened is the premiere online destination for movie enthusiasts,
      providing the latest news and information on casting and development,
      release dates, interviews and all movies rated gist. Screened keeps users
      connected to all their favorites, past, present and future movies/tv
      series. Our sole aim is to become one of the best review websites on the
      internet where you discover, watch and discuss the movies you love.
    </p>
    <h3>What We Do</h3>
    <p>
      We value thought-provoking, informative reviews that credit the
      technicality and themes of a piece as much as the actual content
      on-screen. We lean heavily toward in-depth recaps that detail the majority
      of plot points that occur, mostly for series we believe may be renewed or
      green-lit for another season.
    </p>
    <p>
      We write full season reviews for almost every show we’ve covered on a
      weekly basis as a spoiler-free accompanying piece, acting as a more
      constructive, thoughtful and analytical review alongside our episodic
      snapshots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it is the latest Netflix realease, a Disney production. latest
      Anime or a Korean rom-com, we aim to cover all of these with the same
      enthusiasm and keen eye for detail we would do anything else.
